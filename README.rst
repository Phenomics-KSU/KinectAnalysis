Originally created in Visual Studio 2010 - should work for newer versions.

Allows user to hardcode two files - one being the raw depth data from the kinect (e.g. DepthData.bin) and the other being the infrared image corresponding to that same depth data (eg IR.jpg).  There's an example of two such files in the test_set/ folder.  Just change the absolute path found at the top of MainForm.cs for your computer and run the application.  You should see a colored depth image on the left and the infrared image on the right.  If you click and drag on the infrared image a red box should appear.  When you release it will tell you some basic stats.  All distances are in millimeters.  When it says "Bad" that refers to the number of pixels in the highlighted area that didn't get a depth reading (ie. the depth is 0).
